Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what makes this scroll indicator application special and how it works:

Key Features & How It Works
Real-Time Progress Tracking

Dynamically calculates scroll percentage using scrollY and scrollHeight.

Updates the progress bar width smoothly as you scroll.

Lightweight & Efficient

Pure JavaScript (no dependencies like jQuery).

Minimalist CSS (just 10 lines for styling!).

Visual Appeal

Uses a gradient progress bar (purple-to-blue) for a modern look.

Fixed at the top of the page for clear visibility.

Practical Use Cases

Ideal for blogs, documentation, or long-form content.

Improves UX by giving readers a sense of content length.
